Because the best things in the world are always free, we worked tirelessly to create HOPIN, a completely free (noncommercial) platform for the everyday commuter to be able to share a ride. All that is needed is that you should be on this beautiful planet earth, an Internet connection and a device that can either connect you to our website or lets you use our android application. Then make up your mind about where you want to go, enter it into the source destination field, choose whether you are willing to offer a ride or take a ride and see the users that are going your way. You can check the user profile, that clearly and easily lets you know about the users reputation and helps you make up your mind if you want to share a ride with them or not. Once you have decided with whom you wish to share your ride, or take a ride with just send them a message using our inbuilt chat messenger, and while you are chatting with them either impress them with your charm to let you ride for free or decide on whether you will pay or accept payments in cash or in kind, we have no business what so ever on how you decide to trade with them.   <br>
We currently have an android application that works great and has over 5000 plus downloads on the Google Play Store. Users from around the world have been using it and have given us such encouraging feedbacks that we are now willing to put in a few more sleepless nights and days without our companions and friends, just so that we can make the iOS version of our app.   <br>
For us our users are our only motivation and the fact that we are able to help people commute together is what allows us to improve ourselves every day, and that is the exact reason why we love hearing from every body that wants to talk to us. Use the apps inbuilt help chat messenger and you will be connected to one of our human representative, that will answer any of your math queries and help you finish off your official homework or just hear your suggestion about how we can improve ourselves. Or just click on the contact us section and use either of the several methods by which you can contact us. Until then enjoy HOPING in.  <br>

 <h3> The Hopin Story</h3>
 <h5> An idea is nothing until it has been put into action </h5>

An idea is nothing until it has been put into action. Until July 2012 HOPIN was just that, one of the several dinner discussion topics of a group of once batch mates of the premier engineering institute of India the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. We used to love calling it the “Startup – Startup”.  But having engaging discussions over dinner about the several ideas we used to come up with was just one thing, putting it into reality was another. But as destiny had its way, the five techies who were once batch mates at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, 2010 batch, were now flat mates and determined to create a legacy of their own. We were now a formidable team and working in our areas of expertise towards bringing together the jigsaw puzzle and within four months we had worked our way through to having a prototype app. But we knew the work had only started and after endless iterations on the 28th of March 2013, beta version of the app was launched on the Google Play Store. In another 6 months with multiple iteration and continuous improvements made at several level based purely on the responses received from the users several features were added and the production worthy version of the app was launched. The response from our users was unexpected, our users appreciated the simple and effective UI, and their feedbacks on how we helped them get a ride made it worth it. It was only within ten months that we had crossed the coveted 5000 download mark. When we look back at it we realize that we had achieved these downloads without having spent any money on advertising and this has become one of our greatest achievements.   <br>
While working our way through we realized that the basic requirement of carpooling or ride sharing is dynamism. It was evident to us that people need to be empowered enough to choose:   <br>
--Who they want to commute with  <br>
--What time they want to commute with, and    <br>
--How they plan to compensate or remunerate each other.  <br>
And our app was providing for the dynamism at various levels. But we wanted to be more mobile and easily accessible. We understood that sometimes while working on our office computers its not easy to be able to communicate through our phones. More over no matter from which part of the world you are, to your boss an employee staring at the computer screen is an indication of a hardworking employee as compared to the one chatting on the cell phone. Thus we came up with the idea of evolving ourselves to this website. But creating the app was not sufficient we needed people from other fields, and approached some of our friends, who willingly extended their support and joined in to become a part of our HOPINg TEAM (yeah that’s what we call our selves). We had started with a vision and as we began moving on friends who shared our passion joined in to partner with us. From designing the logo, creating the chat server, working on the android and the iOS app, creating this website, to creating promotional videos, writing blogs, or just spreading the word by shouting out HOPIN at the top of our lungs as we walked on the streets, would not have been possible if it wasn’t for the formidable team of partners who share the same passion and come from different walks of life. Today as we look back, we are no longer just the 5 flat mates who wanted to create a legacy, but we are a big group of HOPPERS who are working tireless and for FREE, towards getting the world to HOPIN with us.  <br>

 <h3> The world has endless possibilities </h3>
 <h5> Nothing stays, time flies, ideas come and go</h5>

  <br>
<p> Man will never fly! Doesn’t have wings and is too heavy, this world is flat and if u keep walking u shall see an end, women can’t run they will die, beyond the clouds is the land of gods and humans are forbidden to the celestial moon.<br>

Do we need to say anything more; human beings have always been bound by boundaries set by the pessimistic them. To say something won’t work is and should be the thing of the gone centuries as years back who could think that we would have the internet, the cell phone, that man could go to the moon, the world was not flat, that women could run and humans could fly.<br>

Saying something wouldn’t work I believe are primitive instincts from the past that have stayed on with us and now is the best time to let go of these instincts.<br>

Recently I came across a blog post that said carpooling wont work and I went on to read the concerns expressed by the author and how strongly opinioned he was that it wont just work and would die out. He even used cute illustrative drawings to say it just wont work. Pretty impressive writing I must say because by the end of the read I myself was too scared to even step out of my own house thinking how scary the Indian roads are with unruly drivers who use horns as weapons to disperse obstacles in front of them and even kowtow bicycle and trucks. Or may be even be stabbed to death by someone’s weird sense of humor, let alone travelling with a psychopath who litters while traveling.<br>

But then I had just one day of travelling from my home to my office and was standing at Wadala station waiting for the taxis and how I hoped I could get someone to go the same way, wish there was a way I could send my message out to the universe that I am traveling to Dadar and if any one is on their way please we could share a cab or you could hitch me a ride and felt the need of a tool that could help.<br>
 
Humans often use tools to do work and when they don’t get these they make them by themselves and surprisingly no one tool has only one application. Born in India we are all aware of the creative selves within us known as Jugadu. We find ways to get things done with the minimum resources available. Not necessary that a carpooling application will only be used as a mainstream carpooling app. There is a lot that could be done with it a lot more and the possibilities are endless.<br>

There are concerns that it may never be mainstream, So what ? It will still help many and open doors for possibilities beyond thinking. <br>
People often share cabs in Mumbai for short distances so wouldn’t it be convenient that while you were approaching your station from where you were to take the cab you could just interact with someone who was either going to be there too , or was already there. Rather than feeling awkward in asking strangers we could communicate in a better way through an online mobile app before time. <br>

If we don’t like the people we travel with in a carpool we are not obliged to travel with them again, there will be many other carpool options available. Its not like we will be bound by a contract to travel with the people we have traveled once with.<br>

There are no special parking spaces or carpool driving lanes in our country so what? We might in future, who knows? <br>

Who says driving a car to work isn’t a social encounter? And we make friends only in a social encounter? People traveling to work in inhabitable crowded Mumbai local’s everyday make this experience a religious one by singing bhajans together and celebrating all festivals too! I am sure that the locals are the least likely of a place to be at a social encounter or at leisure.<br>

There is no point of going on giving reasons why the mobile based applications will help people carpool better or why there are not needed and is a waste of peoples effort. We at HOPIN believe that we are like Thomas Alva Edison who felt the need of an electric bulb, built it and shared it with the world. Hoping for the world to see that this new light will not make them blind but will only go on to light the world and make it a better and an easier place to commute in.<br>

This world has endless possibilities and there are not problems enough or reasons enough no matter how trivial or important, that will death-knell anything let alone carpooling.<br>

<p> Last year when the app was launched the common feed back and apprehension we heard form well wishers was, \'is this app really needed? Is there a market for this product? How will you ensure the safety of the users? Is it safe for female users?\' <br>

But as we enter in to 2014, we enter with the feed back of the several users who have gone on the record to give us some really valuable feedback and suggestions.<br>

We have been listening and acting on what you have told us:<br>

We heard the concerns about the security for women users, and thus we came up with the special filter that allows our women users to just see or be seen by other female users. <br>

We understood that some times we are at a crunch of time and need to do things super quick so we developed the INSTA search feature that helps us raise a ride share request in less than 30 seconds.<br>

You told us our app was a battery drainer, so we decided to focus on how do we fix it, and we came out with versions that were more power efficient, and only after extensive testing for several hours to be true to the expectations in terms of quality. <br>

We promised to remain in constant touch with our users, and understood that they too would want to stay in touch with the people they would be sharing rides with and thus worked towards development and integration of a robust in app instant messenger service.<br>

And much more...<br>

We have been listening and are eager to hear more about our app from you.  We understood that users across the globe, need what we started to build and today it has become yours. HOPIN is no longer our app, its your app and aims at bringing happiness and convenience to you. Go on use HOPIN, spread the word about it and tell us more of what you want so that we can serve you better. <br>
